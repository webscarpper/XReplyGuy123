TECHNICAL SETUP:
Create dashboard route (/dashboard)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
This is just the BASIC LAYOUT and user logic
DO NOT implement automation features yet
Focus on getting user creation/login logic perfect
Ensure all displayed data is real from database
Prepare structure for future features but don't build them yet
Create a solid foundation that properly handles user accounts and displays real user information from the database.
